First, open the polls/urls.py URLconf and change it like so:

polls/urls.pyÂ¶
from django.urls import path

from . import views

app_name = 'polls'
urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.IndexView.as_view(), name='index'),
    path('<int:pk>/', views.DetailView.as_view(), name='detail'),
    path('<int:pk>/results/', views.ResultsView.as_view(), name='results'),
    path('<int:question_id>/vote/', views.vote, name='vote'),
]


Note that the name of the matched pattern in the path strings of the second and third patterns has changed from <question_id> to <pk>.

def vote(request, question_id):
    ... # same as above, no changes needed.
